      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>I have always had a passion for creating and deeply understanding the world around me.  In a world where technology is everywhere, this has naturally led to a passion for web development.  I have grown to love building tangible projects out of nothing more than code, and continually enjoy learning new languages, libraries, and techniques.  I find great comfort in unfamiliar challenges, seeing them as an opportunity to challenge my own limitations as well as create new possibilities to positively affect the world around me.  In my off time, I am typically found learning new instruments, doing yoga, or relaxing and catching up with the people I love most in this world. </p>
